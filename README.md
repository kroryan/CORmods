# Family Inheritance Management Mods

## Disinheritance Mod
A mod that allows you to disinherit family members from your household. With this mod, you can remove the inheritance rights of any living character in your family. Using this action will result in a penalty to your prestige (-10) and influence (-20), reflecting the social impact of such a decision.

**Key Features:**
- Adds a "Disinherit" action for living family members
- Shows a confirmation dialogue before executing the action
- Cannot be used on already disinherited or dead characters
- Includes a custom icon showing a crossed-out inheritance document

## Restore Inheritance Mod
A complementary mod that allows you to restore previously disinherited family members to their inheritance rights. This mod provides a way to undo a disinheritance, granting a small boost to prestige (+5) and influence (+10) as a reward for the reconciliation.

**Key Features:**
- Adds a "Restore Inheritance" action for disinherited family members
- Shows a confirmation dialogue before restoring rights
- Only appears for previously disinherited living characters
- Includes a custom icon showing an approved inheritance document with a green checkmark

Both mods integrate seamlessly into the game's interface and provide appropriate visual feedback through their respective icons and confirmation dialogues.
